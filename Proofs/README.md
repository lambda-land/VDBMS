# Formal Verification of VDBMS
Variational Database Management System accumulates many variated plain schemas and instances in a single variational database (VDB) through variational sets and maps and aptly, allows querying the VDB with variational intent by incorporating choice calculus into traditional relational algebra (RA). The query language of VDBMS, based upon the variational relational algebra (VRA) comes with a static type system that checks validity of variational queries w.r.t  underlying variational schemas and produces variational types. Variation elimination from variational schemas, queries and types, which is called configuration in the given context eventually result in plain schemas, queries and types. For VRA type system to be correct, typing of v-queries must be preserved over variation elimination so that configured variational type of a v-queryâ€™s type is equivalent to the type of configured v-query in RA type system. Moreover, VDBMS provides an implicit way of writing queries relieving users from repeating variation already encoded in v-schema and/or in subqueries. Therefore, type system for checking implicit v-queries must be able to account for implicitness i.e., types of implicit v-queries must be equivalent to the type of their explicit counterpart and hold variation preservation property. However, in previous work on VDBMS, type systems are only assumed to hold these properties. This thesis validates the previous work by providing formal proof of variation preservation for explicit type system, thereby proving its correctness and proof of soundness of the implicit type system with respect to the explicit type system which consequently implies variation preservation for implicit type system.
