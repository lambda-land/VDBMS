# VDBMS

A **variational database management system**, by Parisa Ataei, Qiaoran Li,
Arash Termehchy, and Eric Walkingshaw at Oregon State University.

## Installation
Most of the installation is handled by [Haskell Stack][Stack], which will
automatically install the Haskell compiler (GHC), build system (Cabal), and
other Haskell dependencies.

### Step-by-step installation guide
1. **Install Stack.** Also available via standard package managers, or from the
   [Stack home page][Stack].

2. **Use Stack to complete installation.** Run the following commands in order:

   ```bash
   > stack setup     # downloads the package index and installs GHC
   > stack build     # installs dependencies and builds the project
   ```
