cleaned up enron email database stat:

employeelist(eid, firstname, lastname, email_id, email2, email3, email4, folder, status) -- size: 149 tuples --> unique employees only

message(mid, sender, date, message_id, subject, body, folder) -- size: 252771 --> sender is email address, message_id is a string and not int

recipientinfo(rid, mid, rtype, rvalue, dater) -- size: 2064442 --> rid and mid are int, rtype is enum(TO, CC, BCC), rvalue is email address

referenceinfo(rfid, mid, reference) -- size: 54778 --> rfid and mid are int, reference is a string of crap

enron_mail_20150507.tar.gz --> a folder based dataset of emails
enron-mysqldump_v5.sql.gz --> mysql dump
